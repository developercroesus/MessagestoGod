Using the text box the person would be able to create a text and send it to God however it would just reside on their phone system.  \r\n\r\n\r\n###Questions:\r\n\r\nWould I need to create a fake person in contacts called God?\r\n\r\nWould I need to be able to intercept text messages to this one person and log them into a file on the phone for later retrieval?  \r\n\r\n\r\n###Extras:\r\n\r\nMake it so they can customize the name of their God.\r\n\r\nMake it so they can send pictures of what they want.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
